# Genre Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts movie and tv show genres from text descriptions using NLP.
Designed to practice preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation for text classification tasks

## Learning Outcomes
- Strengthened understanding of NLP preprocessing  
- Practiced end-to-end ML pipeline development (data preparation → model selection → evaluation)  
- Gained experience with scikit-learn models for text classification  
- Improved understanding of evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)  

## Features
- Process raw text descriptions of movie or tv show content
- Generate cleaned and encoded features (TF-IDF matrix)  
- Train and compare multiple classifiers: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Passive Aggressive Classifier, Random Forest, SVC  
- Output predicted genre for unseen text  
- Evaluate model performance with accuracy score and classification report  

## Technology Stack
- Python  
- scikit-learn
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and Python script for reproducibility  

## Future Improvement
- Expand dataset with larger and more diverse text descriptions  
- Experiment with deep learning models (LSTM, BERT)  
- Add web interface or API for genre prediction  
- Deploy model with Flask / FastAPI

## Installation
1. Clone the repository  
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script  
3. Test with sample text inputs
